Welcome to my bootcamp portfolio for Edinburgh College

So far, we have a sample web page created for myself, a javascript challenge, a python challenge and a portfolio website.

Inside of the WWW website, we have a prime number function, and a webpage for JS Rock Paper Scissors, as well as my first website made with HTML and Bootstrap 5.2

Python Challenge - This has the Rock Paper Scissors task written in python instead.

As for the python project and javascript projects, I won't be adding the steps leading up to the project as most of the information is subjects i've already touched upon in other languages such as C and Python.

I have now completed the SQL and Portfolio section of my bootcamp and I am ready to upload.

The javascript challenge of Rock Paper Scissors is inside of "Other Projects" inside of my WWW web page, it has a functioning GUI.

The main portfolio website is under the direcetory "MK TIME", and contains a website designed by myself.
