Welcome to my bootcamp portfolio for Edinburgh College

So far, we have a sample web page created for myself.

Inside of the WWW website, we have a prime number function, and a webpage for JS Rock Paper Scissors

Python Challenge - This has the Rock Paper Scissors task written in python instead.

As for the python project and javascript projects, I won't be adding the steps leading up to the project as most of the information is subjects i've already touched upon in other languages such as C and Python.
